# Intro to AI Capstone project by Group 20
The capstone project of Group 20 for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course on Chess with AI.

This is our chess program where the player will play against an intelligent agent designed to play chess.

To load our work: 'git clone https://github.com/bachthetrollface/intro-ai-group20'

To install required libraries: 'pip install -q -r requirements.txt'

To run the program: 'python main.py'

Should the program start successfully, you can engage in a match of chess against our chess-playing bot. You (the player) will take the white side, and the bot will take the black side. Make a move by clicking on a piece of yours to select it, then click on a highlighted position, which is a possible move, to move the piece there. Afterwards, wait for the bot to think of a response and then repeat the process.

During a match, the terminal will display several informations such as best moves found and the move chosen by the bot, heuristic values of the chessboard after each move, etc., and when the game ends it will also display a message telling whether it is a draw or a victory for a side. When a King is checked, its position will be highlighted with a pink color, and for a checkmate it will be a red color, signifying a loss for that King's side.

You can end the game at any time when it is your turn by clicking the Quit (Close) button to terminate the program. When the game ends, the window will linger for about 5 seconds before closing automatically.
